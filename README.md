# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go. 

# About me
Hi! I am Sara an exchange student at Carnegie Mellon University at Heinz College studying Management and Informationsystems. I am pursuing a Masters in Management at the University of Mannheim in Germany. I really like data. I am fascinated by the opportunities data provides us with to learn and optimize. I like visualizations, they are a tool to make data usable for a greater audience.  So I guess you can say that I like data visualizations!

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. The following three aspects are the key aspects I am interested in:

1. How to effectivelly use data to tell a story to convince problem to take action.
2. How to sketch graphs and charts
3. Learning how to create good charts through the analysis of others charts.
