# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go. You can navigate through the different subpages through the header at the top. The content on this website was either developed for practice tasks or for work towards the final project of the telling stories with data class.

# About me
Hi! I am Sara an exchange student at Carnegie Mellon University at Heinz College studying Management and Informationsystems. I am pursuing a Masters in Management at the University of Mannheim in Germany. I really like data. I am fascinated by the opportunities data provides us with to learn and optimize. I like visualizations, they are a tool to make data usable for a greater audience.  So I guess you can say that I like data visualizations!

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. The following three aspects are the key aspects I am interested in:

1. How to effectivelly use data to tell a story to convince problem to take action.
2. How to sketch graphs and charts.
3. Learning how to create good charts through the analysis of others charts.
