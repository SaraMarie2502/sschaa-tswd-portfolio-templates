# The final data story


# Changes made since Part II
I have made a lot of changes since part II. For example certain sections were left out as they were too far away from the key story. I also adjust the color scheme and worked with simple charts. I incorporated buttons to link to websites to get more information to make the website more interactive as suggested based on the feedback I received through the interviews. Overall in this phase I have really filled the shorthand website with content. In part II my shorthand website was only a sketch/wireframe which showed the color scheme  and the structure of my story but the vizualizations were not yet incorporated. 

## The audience
The most important work regarding identifying and building the story for my target audience was performed in part II. Since then the user persona and interviews have helped me. Since I got confirmation from the interviewees that the story is interesting for them, i didn't adapt much more of the story telling aspect.


Initially I really struggeled to narrow down the subject and focus on just one target audience. Therefore, I spent a lot of time in specifying my subject so it is specific for a specific group. I decided to develop a story for students more specifically students which are about to graduate within a year. My story is focusing on the impact a job decision has to use your resources towards achieving 1.5 degrees global warming. 
My approach included a lot of brainstorming, I thought about different directions this project could go into but decided I really wanted to focus on students and create a call to action which has a strong message and is also hopefull.

The development of my user persona has helped me to further narrow down my story and keep it aligned to the actual target audience and not digress from the main story.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

I have learnt how important feedback is and how difficult it is to develop a compelling story which can be grasped within 60 seconds. It is really important to keep it simple and break it down to key messages. Designing charts and statements on the website is essential to ensure the story can be understood within the limited time. I tried to reduce distraction from irrelevant information. For example by color coding only specific contries/regions in the bubble chart I created. Additionally I really tried to go from a dark theme to a bright theme when my story changes from there is so much to do to and there are so many challenges to there is already progress made and this is what we can do.

Overall I spent a lot of time on deciding what data to include to support the story. I identified many interesting data sources, but they were not really supporting the story there were broad and nice to know facts but didn't fit to the story. Deciding which data to use and how to present it took a lot of time and I really tried to also design them somewhat consistent. For example as those charts were used in the dark mode of the presentation I also created them on a dark background. I really got inspired to do it that way through the Netflix Documentation Racial Wealth Gap Explained. They did a really good job with the vizualizations and I tried to use them as an inspiration using red or orange as highlight colors and gray/white for less important areas.

## References
All the sources I have used are referenced on my shorthand website. 

## AI acknowledgements
I have created one chart with AI which I have highlighted on shorthand. I also asked chatgpt for title proposals as I wanted to have something that makes people interested in the topic. I provided chatgpt with my story and aked for proposals. 


# Final thoughts
There is so much more data available and with more time the story could have been a little smoothers. The feedback I received was very valuable, but I believe even more feedback rounds would have made it even better.
