# Critique by Design - New Year's Resolution
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

I selected this data source from Make over Monday, as it seemed interesting to me to better understand New Years Resolutions with some data about it. Most my friends made New Years Resolutions and I am not a big fan of the concept as I believe goals can be and should be set through out the year and should be small enough to be actually achievable. 

The specific chart was chosen because it was interesting data but not perfectly presented and I saw an opprtunity for improvements.

## Step two: the critique
### Positive Aspects of the Graph
- Relevant Title: The title aligns well with the subject matter of the graph.
- Legend: Includes a clear legend explaining which color represents each category.
- Scale: A scale is provided, allowing for a rough understanding of the share of each category.
- Source Link: The graph includes a source link for the data beneath the chart.
- Color Palette: A pleasing color palette is used, transitioning from dark blue to green, where green represents a successful New Year's resolution.

### Critiques and Suggestions
- Chart Type: The stacked bar chart is not an appropriate choice; a regular bar chart would improve readability. It makes it difficult to compare the sizes of each category.
- Visual Quality: The graph is blurry and should be uploaded with higher resolution.
- Source Link Accessibility: The source link is not clickable, which limits user interaction.
- Color Contrast: The colors for "quit in the first week" and "quit within the first month" are not distinct enough and can be hard to differentiate.
- Chart Placement: The chart should be presented first, with explanatory text following. Ideally, the graph should be self-explanatory so that accompanying text is unnecessary.
- Content Alignment: The article’s purpose is to help readers with New Year’s resolutions and provide actionable insights on achieving them. This goal becomes clear only at the end of the article but should be evident earlier. The graphs focus on challenges (e.g., quitting resolutions early), which aligns with the theme but fails to provide direct solutions or actionable advice.
- External Links: The article redirects readers to additional content, such as: an article on books for setting and achieving goals; a website promoting a costly planner for tracking goals. These links feel promotional and do not directly help readers achieve their goals within the article itself.

### Improvements to Achieve Clarity and Usability
- Add actionable advice or recommendations directly within the article rather than solely redirecting to external resources.
- Represent data in a dfferent data chart type that provides better readability (e.g., regular bar chart).
- Use more distinct colors for easier visual differentiation.
- Make the source link clickable for user convenience.
- Enhance the chart resolution for better visual quality.
- Reorganize content so that the goal of helping users with resolutions is clear from the beginning.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

#### Questions I asked:

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Do you have an idea for an alternative way to visualize the data?

#### Interviewed People

Person 1: 
- Master in Management Arts
- End 20's
- Work experience in research
  
Person 2: 
- Master in Management and Information Systems
- Work experience in Banking
- End 20's

Person 3:
- Master in Public and Policy Management
- Mid 20's
- Work experience with customer service, legal research, and administrative skills

Results: 

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Can you tell me what you think this is?|             |             |             |
|Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?|Not really| For me it is not completly clear what the story is.|Everything is clear.|
|Is there anything you would change or do differently?|             |             |             |
|Do you have an idea for an alternative way to visualize the data?|             |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
