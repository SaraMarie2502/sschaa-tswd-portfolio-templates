# Wireframes / storyboards
I have further developed my project directly in shorthand. As you can see in shorthand my story is much more specific and narrowed down than part 1. I have changed the focus sligthly. While creating the shorthand website I continued to follow my storyline mood chart that we drafted in class going from the Intro part to the current state, opportunities to the solution. The story unfolds, as we learned it in class from conflict over context to resolution applying the guideline SIX of the workbook good data viz.

# User research 
For my user research I started thinking in more depth about my target audience and from that started developing my interview script and who I want to interview. The interviews were very valuable and I was able to identify opportunities for improvement based on their input.  

## Target audience
Initially I really struggeled to narrow down the subject and focus on just one target audience. Therefore, I spent a lot of time in specifying my subject so it is specific for a specific group. I decided to develop a story for students more specifically students which are about to graduate within a year. My story is focusing on the impact a job decision has to use your resources towards achieving 1.5 degrees global warming. 
The approach included a lot of brainstorming I thought about different directions this project could go into but decided I really wanted to focus on students and create a call to action which has a strong message and is also hopefull.

### User persona

### Identify representatives of the target audience
I used the opportunity to interview people within the telling stories with data class, as they are my target audience. Additionally, I interviewed my flatmates which are seniors at CMU. They are planning to enter into the workforce soon.

## Interview script
In the following table I have listed down the questions I planned to ask my interviewees with the corresponding goal. Overall I was trying to develop questions which help me develop a better story and compelling data visualisations. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Ensure that the story is clear or if any changes are required. |Is there anything confusing or unclear about the story?|
|Identify if I can add arguments and charts to convince my target audience. |What would motivate you to take actions in the directions of this story?|
|Receive more ideas for my story and ensure it is relatable to my target audience.|Do you have suggestions for making the story more compelling or relatable?|
|Identify what visualizations should be part of my final presentation with shorthand and which one would be a nice addition as context for my github page.|What data visualizations would you look for in this story?|

# Identified changes for Part III

I have identified opportunities for changes to make my final story more compelling. Since we had the chance to receive feedback twice. I was already able to implement some of the feedback I received into my shorthand website. I have made changes to the coloring and the selected pictures. Thee feedback I have not been able to implement yet and plan to do over the next week is regarding data visualisations and adding interactive elements into my website e.g. through providing links to websites with additional information.
